# About *Rakan Almana*

I am 15 years old who lives in *Amman, Jordan* and have been living there for my whole life. I am a student in the *American Community School* and have been attending the school for 11 years. The subject I do most well in and enjoy alot is **MATH**! The reason why I enjoy it is because It helps me make sense of things, specificaly numbers, and also helps alot in real word situations. I signed up for *Computer Science* for the same reason reason because I wanted to make sense of how a computer works, because of their complicated codes.
